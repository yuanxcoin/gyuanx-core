## Information

Gyuanx coin is a fork of Monero project and The rebranded Oxen projects. Gyuanx gives a better privacy and makes user to gain complete anonymity during blockchain transactions, this makes both the gyuanx users to stay completely anonymous with vast ranges iof privacy. What are hidden are the wallet addresses as well as balances. Though it is a fork of both oxen and monero, gyuanx has its different variants and functionalities.

Gyuanx is an open source project, and we encourage contributions from anyone with something to offer. For more information on contributing, please contact team@gyuanx.network

## Compiling Gyuanx from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system,
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[1] On Ubuntu Bionic you will need the g++-8 package instead of g++ (which is version 7) and will
need to run `export CC=gcc-8 CXX=g++-8` before running `make` or `cmake`.

[2] libboost-all-dev includes a lot of unnecessary packages; see the apt command below for a
breakdown of the minimum set of required boost packages.

Install all dependencies at once on Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install g++ cmake pkg-config libboost-thread-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
    libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libsqlite3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev \
    libldns-dev libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Install all dependencies at once on macOS with the provided Brewfile:
``` brew update && brew bundle --file=contrib/brew/Brewfile ```

FreeBSD one liner for required to build dependencies
```pkg install git gmake cmake pkgconf boost-libs libzmq4 libsodium sqlite3 openssl unbound miniupnpc```

### Cloning the repository

Clone recursively to pull-in needed submodule(s):

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/yuanxcoin/gyuanx`

If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:

`$ cd gyuanx && git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Build instructions

Gyuanx uses the CMake build system and an optional top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that wraps cmake
commands as needed (alternatively you may create a build directory and invoke cmake directly).

#### On Linux and macOS

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory, change to the most recent release branch, and build:

    ```bash
    cd gyuanx
    git checkout master
    make
    ```

    *Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and at least 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: The instructions above will compile the most stable release of the
    Gyuanx software. If you would like to use and test the most recent software,
    use ```git checkout master```. The master branch may contain updates that are
    both unstable and incompatible with release software, though testing is always
    encouraged.

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/gyuanx/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Gyuanx with `gyuanxd --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

    ```bash
    make release-test
    ```

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

    ```bash
    make debug
    ```

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

    ```bash
    make release-static
    ```

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

    ```bash
    HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile
    ```

#### On the Raspberry Pi (and similar ARM-based devices)

The build process is exactly the same, but note that some parts of the build require around 3GB of
RAM which is more memory than most Raspberry Pi class devices have available.  You can work around
this by enabling 2GB (or more) of swap, but this is not particularly recommended, particularly if
the swap file is on the SD card: intensive writes to a swap file on an SD card can accelerate how
quickly the SD card wears out.  Devices with 4GB of RAM (such as the 4GB model of the Pi 4B, and
some other SBC ARM devices) can build without needing swap.

As an alternative, pre-built gyuanx debs are available for ARM32 and ARM64 for recent
Debian/Raspbian/Ubuntu distributions and are often a much better alternative for SBC-class devices.
If you still want to compile from source, ensure you have enough memory (or swap -- consult your OS
documentation to learn how to enable or increase swap size) and follow the regular linux build
instructions above.

#### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](https://www.msys2.org). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](https://www.msys2.org), either the 64-bit (x86_64) or the 32-bit (i686) package, depending on your system.
* Note: Installation must be on the C drive and root directory as result of [Monero issue 3167](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/3167).
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 MSYS` shortcut in the Start Menu or "C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd -msys"
* Update packages using pacman:  

    ```bash
    pacman -Syu
    ```

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4 when you get a warning stating: "terminate MSYS2 without returning to shell and check for updates again/for example close your terminal window instead of calling exit"

    ```bash
    pacman -Syu
    ```

* Update packages again using pacman: 

        pacman -Syu  

* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

    ```bash
    pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3 mingw-w64-x86_64-unbound
    ```

    To build for 32-bit Windows:

    ```bash
    pacman -S git mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium mingw-w64-i686-hidapi mingw-w64-i686-sqlite3 mingw-w64-i686-unbound
    ```

* Close and reopen the MSYS MinGW shell via `MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` shortcut on
  64-bit Windows or `MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note 
  that if you are running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and
  32-bit MinGW shells.

**Cloning**

* To git clone, run:

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/yuanxcoin/gyuanx.git
    ```

**Building**

* Change to the cloned directory, run:
	
    ```bash
    cd gyuanx
    ```

* If you would like a specific [version/tag](https://github.com/yuanxcoin/gyuanx/tags), do a git checkout for that version. eg. 'v5.1.2'. If you don't care about the version and just want binaries from master, skip this step:
	
    ```bash
    git checkout v5.1.2
    ```

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

    ```bash
    make release-static-win64
    ```

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

    ```bash
    make release-static-win32
    ```

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/<MinGW version>/<gyuanx version>/release/bin`

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 64-bit system, run:

    ```bash
    make debug-static-win64
    ```

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 32-bit system, run:

    ```bash
    make debug-static-win32
    ```

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/<MinGW version>/<gyuanx version>/debug/bin`

### On FreeBSD:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Linux above(but use `gmake` instead of `make`). 
If you are running Gyuanx in a jail, you need to add `sysvsem="new"` to your jail configuration, otherwise lmdb will throw the error message: `Failed to open lmdb environment: Function not implemented`.

### On OpenBSD:

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add cmake gmake zeromq cppzmq libiconv boost`.

The `doxygen` and `graphviz` packages are optional and require the xbase set.
Running the test suite also requires `py-requests` package.

Build gyuanx: `env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local gmake release-static`

Note: you may encounter the following error, when compiling the latest version of gyuanx as a normal user:

```
LLVM ERROR: out of memory
c++: error: unable to execute command: Abort trap (core dumped)
```

Then you need to increase the data ulimit size to 2GB and try again: `ulimit -d 2000000`

### On Solaris:

The default Solaris linker can't be used, you have to install GNU ld, then run cmake manually with the path to your copy of GNU ld:

```bash
mkdir -p build/release
cd build/release
cmake -DCMAKE_LINKER=/path/to/ld -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
cd ../..
```

Then you can run make as usual.

### On Linux for Android (using docker):

```bash
# Build image (for ARM 32-bit)
docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android32.Dockerfile -t gyuanx-android .
# Build image (for ARM 64-bit)
docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android64.Dockerfile -t gyuanx-android .
# Create container
docker create -it --name gyuanx-android gyuanx-android bash
# Get binaries
docker cp gyuanx-android:/src/build/release/bin .
```

### Building portable statically linked binaries

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems

### Cross Compiling

You can also cross-compile static binaries on Linux for Windows and macOS with the `depends` system.

* ```make depends target=x86_64-linux-gnu``` for 64-bit linux binaries.
* ```make depends target=x86_64-w64-mingw32``` for 64-bit windows binaries.
  * Requires: `python3 g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 wine1.6 bc`
* ```make depends target=x86_64-apple-darwin11``` for macOS binaries.
  * Requires: `cmake imagemagick libcap-dev librsvg2-bin libz-dev libbz2-dev libtiff-tools python-dev`
* ```make depends target=i686-linux-gnu``` for 32-bit linux binaries.
  * Requires: `g++-multilib bc`
* ```make depends target=i686-w64-mingw32``` for 32-bit windows binaries.
  * Requires: `python3 g++-mingw-w64-i686`
* ```make depends target=arm-linux-gnueabihf``` for armv7 binaries.
  * Requires: `g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf`
* ```make depends target=aarch64-linux-gnu``` for armv8 binaries.
  * Requires: `g++-aarch64-linux-gnu`
* ```make depends target=riscv64-linux-gnu``` for RISC V 64 bit binaries.
  * Requires: `g++-riscv64-linux-gnu`

The required packages are the names for each toolchain on apt. Depending on your distro, they may have different names.

Using `depends` might also be easier to compile Gyuanx on Windows than using MSYS. Activate Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with a distro (for example Ubuntu), install the apt build-essentials and follow the `depends` steps as depicted above.

The produced binaries still link libc dynamically. If the binary is compiled on a current distribution, it might not run on an older distribution with an older installation of libc. Passing `-DBACKCOMPAT=ON` to cmake will make sure that the binary will run on systems having at least libc version 2.17.

## Installing Gyuanx from a package

Pre-built packages are available for recent Debian and Ubuntu systems (and are often usable on
Debian or Ubuntu-derived Linux distributions).  For more details see https://deb.imaginary.stream



You can also build a docker package using:

    ```bash
    # Build using all available cores
    docker build -t gyuanx-daemon-image .
    
    # or build using a specific number of cores (reduce RAM requirement)
    docker build --build-arg NPROC=1 -t gyuanx .
    
    # either run in foreground
    docker run -it -v /gyuanx/chain:/root/.gyuanx -v /gyuanx/wallet:/wallet -p 22022:22022 gyuanx
    
    # or in background
    docker run -it -d -v /gyuanx/chain:/root/.gyuanx -v /gyuanx/wallet:/wallet -p 22022:22022 gyuanx
    ```

* The build needs 3 GB space.
* Wait one hour or more. For docker, the collect_from_docker_container.sh script will automate downloading the binaries from the docker container.

## Running gyuanxd

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in
foreground:

```bash
./bin/gyuanxd
```

To list all available options, run `./bin/gyuanxd --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

```bash
./bin/gyuanxd --log-file gyuanxd.log --detach
```

To run as a systemd service, copy
[gyuanxd.service](utils/systemd/gyuanxd.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[gyuanxd.conf](utils/conf/gyuanxd.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/gyuanxd.service) assumes that the user `gyuanx` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](utils/conf/gyuanxd.conf).

If you're on Mac, you may need to add the `--max-concurrency 1` option to
gyuanx-wallet-cli, and possibly gyuanxd, if you get crashes refreshing.

## Internationalization

See [README.i18n.md](README.i18n.md).

## Using Tor

> There is a new, still experimental, [integration with Tor](ANONYMITY_NETWORKS.md). The
> feature allows connecting over IPv4 and Tor simulatenously - IPv4 is used for
> relaying blocks and relaying transactions received by peers whereas Tor is
> used solely for relaying transactions received over local RPC. This provides
> privacy and better protection against surrounding node (sybil) attacks.

While Gyuanx isn't made to integrate with Tor, it can be used wrapped with torsocks, by
setting the following configuration parameters and environment variables:

* `--p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1` on the command line or `p2p-bind-ip=127.0.0.1` in
  gyuanxd.conf to disable listening for connections on external interfaces.
* `--no-igd` on the command line or `no-igd=1` in gyuanxd.conf to disable IGD
  (UPnP port forwarding negotiation), which is pointless with Tor.
* `DNS_PUBLIC=tcp` or `DNS_PUBLIC=tcp://x.x.x.x` where x.x.x.x is the IP of the
  desired DNS server, for DNS requests to go over TCP, so that they are routed
  through Tor. When IP is not specified, gyuanxd uses the default list of
  servers defined in [src/common/dns_utils.cpp](src/common/dns_utils.cpp).
* `TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1` to tell torsocks to allow gyuanxd to bind to interfaces
   to accept connections from the wallet. On some Linux systems, torsocks
   allows binding to localhost by default, so setting this variable is only
   necessary to allow binding to local LAN/VPN interfaces to allow wallets to
   connect from remote hosts. On other systems, it may be needed for local wallets
   as well.
* Do NOT pass `--detach` when running through torsocks with systemd, (see
  [utils/systemd/gyuanxd.service](utils/systemd/gyuanxd.service) for details).
* If you use the wallet with a Tor daemon via the loopback IP (eg, 127.0.0.1:9050),
  then use `--untrusted-daemon` unless it is your own hidden service.

Example command line to start gyuanxd through Tor:

```bash
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp torsocks gyuanxd --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd
```

### Using Tor on Tails

TAILS ships with a very restrictive set of firewall rules. Therefore, you need
to add a rule to allow this connection too, in addition to telling torsocks to
allow inbound connections. Full example:

```bash
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 -m tcp --dport 22023 -j ACCEPT
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp torsocks ./gyuanxd --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 \
    --data-dir /home/amnesia/Persistent/your/directory/to/the/blockchain
```

## Debugging

This section contains general instructions for debugging failed installs or problems encountered with Gyuanx. First ensure you are running the latest version built from the Github repo.

### Obtaining stack traces and core dumps on Unix systems

We generally use the tool `gdb` (GNU debugger) to provide stack trace functionality, and `ulimit` to provide core dumps in builds which crash or segfault.

* To use `gdb` in order to obtain a stack trace for a build that has stalled:

Run the build.

Once it stalls, enter the following command:

```bash
gdb /path/to/gyuanxd `pidof gyuanxd`
```

Type `thread apply all bt` within gdb in order to obtain the stack trace

* If however the core dumps or segfaults:

Enter `ulimit -c unlimited` on the command line to enable unlimited filesizes for core dumps

Enter `echo core | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to stop cores from being hijacked by other tools

Run the build.

When it terminates with an output along the lines of "Segmentation fault (core dumped)", there should be a core dump file in the same directory as gyuanxd. It may be named just `core`, or `core.xxxx` with numbers appended.

You can now analyse this core dump with `gdb` as follows:

```bash
gdb /path/to/gyuanxd /path/to/dumpfile`
```

Print the stack trace with `bt`

 * If a program crashed and cores are managed by systemd, the following can also get a stack trace for that crash:

```bash
coredumpctl -1 gdb
```

#### To run Gyuanx within gdb:

Type `gdb /path/to/gyuanxd`

Pass command-line options with `--args` followed by the relevant arguments

Type `run` to run gyuanxd

### Analysing memory corruption

There are two tools available:

#### ASAN

Configure Gyuanx with the -D SANITIZE=ON cmake flag, eg:

```bash
cd build/debug && cmake -D SANITIZE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
```

You can then run the gyuanx tools normally. Performance will typically halve.

#### valgrind

Install valgrind and run as `valgrind /path/to/gyuanxd`. It will be very slow.

### LMDB

Instructions for debugging suspected blockchain corruption as per @HYC

There is an `mdb_stat` command in the LMDB source that can print statistics about the database but it's not routinely built. This can be built with the following command:

```bash
cd ~/gyuanx/external/db_drivers/liblmdb && make
```

The output of `mdb_stat -ea <path to blockchain dir>` will indicate inconsistencies in the blocks, block_heights and block_info table.

The output of `mdb_dump -s blocks <path to blockchain dir>` and `mdb_dump -s block_info <path to blockchain dir>` is useful for indicating whether blocks and block_info contain the same keys.

These records are dumped as hex data, where the first line is the key and the second line is the data.

# Known Issues

## Protocols

### Socket-based

Because of the nature of the socket-based protocols that drive Gyuanx, certain protocol weaknesses are somewhat unavoidable at this time. While these weaknesses can theoretically be fully mitigated, the effort required (the means) may not justify the ends. As such, please consider taking the following precautions if you are a Gyuanx node operator:

- Run `gyuanxd` on a "secured" machine. If operational security is not your forte, at a very minimum, have a dedicated a computer running `gyuanxd` and **do not** browse the web, use email clients, or use any other potentially harmful apps on your `gyuanxd` machine. **Do not click links or load URL/MUA content on the same machine**. Doing so may potentially exploit weaknesses in commands which accept "localhost" and "127.0.0.1".
- If you plan on hosting a public "remote" node, start `gyuanxd` with `--restricted-rpc`. This is a must.

### Blockchain-based

Certain blockchain "features" can be considered "bugs" if misused correctly. Consequently, please consider the following:

- When receiving Gyuanx, be aware that it may be locked for an arbitrary time if the sender elected to, preventing you from spending that Gyuanx until the lock time expires. You may want to hold off acting upon such a transaction until the unlock time lapses. To get a sense of that time, you can consider the remaining blocktime until unlock as seen in the `show_transfers` command.
