Suggests: gyuanx-blockchain-tools, gyuanx-wallet-cli
Description: Gyuanx network daemon
 This package contains the gyuanx network daemon, gyuanxd, for running a gyuanx node
 or gyuanx service node.

Package: gyuanx-wallet-cli

Suggests: gyuanxd
Description: Gyuanx command-line wallet and JSON RPC wallet
 This package contains binaries for accessing a wallet stored on the Gyuanx
 blockchain.  Both a command-line interface (gyuanx-wallet-cli) and a JSON RPC
 interface (gyuanx-wallet-rpc) are provided.
 .
 The wallets require a gyuanxd node to work, such as the one provided in the
 gyuanxd package, but can also work with a remote Gyuanx node.

Suggests: gyuanxd
Description: Gyuanx RPC wallet
 This package contains the Gyuanx JSON RPC wallet interface to accessing a wallet
 on the Gyuanx blockchain.  This wallet interface is typically used by external
 software that needs to interact with a wallet.
 .
 The wallet requires a gyuanxd node to work, such as the one provided in the
 gyuanxd package, but can also work with a remote Gyuanx node.
